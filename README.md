### What is DBD-Guardian?
Distributed Big Data Guardian is a Big Data Cybersecurity architetural proposal that employs a distributed big data query engine to provide real-time monitoring for a multitude of hosts throughout a network, all while mitigating the requirement for extensive resource consumption, such as storage space. Furthermore, DBD-Guardian includes a privacy feature designed to anonymize sensitive data, ensuring data security and compliance, as well as an API designed to allow users to develop and incorporate their costume modules.

This solution is highly customizable, enabling users to adapt its functionality to suit their specific needs, allowing DBD-Guardian to be effectively implemented in a wide range of use cases. 

### DBD-Guardian's Paper Abstract
As computers, the Internet of Things (IoT), and telecommunications technologies become commonplace in everyday life and systems become interconnected via the Internet, cybersecurity has turned out to be a relevant and challenging issue. Several different technologies and implementations have come up in response to cope with the growing challenges in the world of cybersecurity. One of these solutions is Big Data Cybersecurity Analytics, which results from the fusion between two distinct areas, Cybersecurity and Big Data Analytics. 

By enabling data analysis from different sources and applying knowledge extraction techniques, Big Data Cybersecurity Analytics allows one to get better insights into the security status of the systems and IT infrastructures. 

But Big Data Cybersecurity Analytics have proper characteristics and requirements, like a wide range of heterogeneous data sources, the processing of data with privacy requirements, and the need for near real-time conclusions. BDCA systems that can respond to all these challenges are still hard to find nowadays.

In this paper, we review existing solutions for big data cybersecurity analytics. We discuss tools, technologies, applications, and current challenges. We then discuss a proposal for a BDCA system architecture, the “DBD-Guardian”, designed to address the identified challenges. Finally, our implementation and testing of the DBD-Guardian architecture will be presented and discussed.
